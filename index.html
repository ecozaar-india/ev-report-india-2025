  <h1>EV Industry Report India 2025</h1>
  <p>The Indian electric vehicle (EV) industry continues to surge ahead in 2025, driven by government support, rising fuel prices, and growing consumer awareness of sustainable alternatives. As a trusted platform helping consumers navigate this evolving space, <a href="https://ecozaar.in" target="_blank">Ecozaar.in</a> provides comparisons, pricing, and policy insights on EV two-wheelers across India.</p>

  <h2>Market Overview</h2>
  <p>India's EV market is projected to reach over $113 billion by 2029, with a CAGR of more than 66% from 2023 to 2030 (source: IMARC Group, IBEF). In FY2024-25, over 2.1 million EVs were sold across the country, with electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers dominating the volume. States like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka are leading EV adoption, thanks to targeted state-level subsidies and infrastructure incentives.</p>

  <h2>Key Growth Drivers in 2025</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Government Incentives:</strong> FAME II subsidies were extended till March 2025, and a new FAME III policy draft focuses on localized battery production and affordable EV financing.</li>
    <li><strong>Urban EV Penetration:</strong> Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities now contribute nearly 60% of total EV sales, with charging hubs in residential complexes and malls becoming standard.</li>
    <li><strong>Corporate Fleet Electrification:</strong> Startups and delivery giants like Zomato, Flipkart, and Amazon have pledged to electrify up to 80% of their fleets by 2027.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Electric Two-Wheelers: The Driving Force</h2>
  <p>Two-wheelers remain the backbone of India’s EV growth. In 2025, over 1.6 million electric scooters and bikes were registered, a 23% rise from the previous year. Brands like Ola Electric, Ather Energy, TVS, and Bajaj continue to innovate with longer ranges, swappable batteries, and smart connectivity features.</p>
  <p>Ecozaar plays a key role here, providing a transparent platform for buyers to explore options under ₹1 lakh, ₹1.5 lakh, and ₹3 lakh price segments, complete with performance reviews and EMI calculators.</p>

  <h2>Challenges and Roadblocks</h2>
  <p>Despite the optimism, the EV sector faces notable hurdles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Charging Infrastructure Gaps:</strong> While metros are well-equipped, smaller towns still lack fast-charging stations.</li>
    <li><strong>Battery Recycling:</strong> India generates over 20,000 tonnes of EV battery waste annually. Efficient recycling systems are still in nascent stages.</li>
    <li><strong>Consumer Trust:</strong> First-time buyers often hesitate due to limited awareness and confusing subsidy structures.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What’s Ahead for 2025 and Beyond</h2>
  <p>Looking forward, the Indian EV industry is expected to see rapid adoption of EV financing, battery-as-a-service (BaaS) models, and AI-powered energy analytics. The push for local cell manufacturing under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme is also expected to reduce EV prices by 10–15% by 2026.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, platforms like <a href="https://ecozaar.in" target="_blank">Ecozaar.in</a> continue to educate, guide, and connect EV consumers with the latest product launches, dealership offers, and state-wise EV policies.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>India’s EV market is at a historic inflection point in 2025. With robust policy support, expanding infrastructure, and increasing consumer demand, the country is well on its way to becoming one of the world’s top three EV markets. For consumers and businesses alike, it’s time to plug into the electric future—and Ecozaar is here to guide that journey.</p>
